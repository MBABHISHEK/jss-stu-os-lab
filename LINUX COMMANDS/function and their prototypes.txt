 * Prototype: char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)
 * int feof(FILE *stream) tests the end-of-file indicator for the given stream.
 * strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the given substring in the given string.
 * Prototype: char *strstr(const char *haystack, const char *needle)

3.ls COMMAND
 * The ls command lists all the files present in the given directory.
 * The <dirent.h> header defines the following data type through typedef:
 *     DIR is a type representing the directory stream.

 *           => ino_t d_ino //File serial name.
 *           => char d_name //Name of the directory.
 * The type ino_t is defined in the header <sys/types.h>, and is used for file serial numbers.
 * The . present in the output represents the current directory.
 * The .. present in the output represents the parent director.
